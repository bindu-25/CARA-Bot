* Automatic **contract type classification** (e.g., Service Agreement, Employment Agreement)
* Extraction of:

  * Parties involved
  * Key dates
  * Financial amounts
  * Clause structure

### 2. Clause-Level Analysis

Each clause is analyzed and tagged with:

* **Clause Type** (Termination, Payment, IP, Non-Compete, etc.)
* **Risk Level** (High / Medium / Low)
* **Clause Nature** (Right / Obligation / Prohibition)
* **Ambiguity Detection**

  * Example: “Amount is not specified”, “No defined scope”

### 3. Risk Assessment Engine

* Overall **Risk Score (0–100)**
* Separate assessment for:

  * Legal Risk
  * Financial Risk
  * Compliance Risk
* Explicit detection of risk flags:

  * Penalty clauses
  * Unilateral termination
  * Missing liability caps
  * Indemnity clauses
  * Non-compete & IP transfer clauses
  * Auto-renewal risks

  * Indian Contract Act, 1872
  * Employment and labor regulations (where applicable)
